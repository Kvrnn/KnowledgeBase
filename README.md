This is a link to the authors and researchers who publish the material I steal. Without them, the world would be a lot harder.

### [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

Shoutout to them at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for creating something so stupidly advance. Without them I would have failed my Biology course and this readme would have no description.
