# Hardware Setup
For context, I am using a IP provided WISP AP connected to a [hAP acÂ³](https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ac3)

1) Unbox? If you want too
2) Connect to [Power](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Power)
3) Connect to WAN - Plug in an ethernet cable into port 1 from your internet source.
4) Connect to LAN - Either directly via ethernet or via the WiFi connection. Check your hardware manual for instructions.
5) Click the on button
# Connecting to the Router
MAKE SURE YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE ROUTER ALREADY!

On Windows, open Command Prompt and run
```bash
ipconfig
```
And look for your Default Gateway for the router's ip

# Web GUI / Control Panel

Located under the `Local Network` Block in the `Quick Set` Configuration page you have access to your DHCP settings.

## DHCP Server Range
This is an entry for a IP block that will be used on devices that connect to the device. This is the range of IP's that will be issued to your users.
Some example blocks include:
1)  `192.168.88.10-192.168.88.254` 
2)  `10.0.0.100-10.0.0.254`
3) `192.168.1.10-192.168.1.254`

1 is the Default DHCP Server range btw.
