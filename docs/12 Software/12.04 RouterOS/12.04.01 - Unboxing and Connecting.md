Just a notice, this guide was made for RouterOS on a [hAP ac³](https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ac3). This is not a guide for installing and setting up RouterOS onto anything else. Despite this, the configuration of RouterOS should be the same beyond the installation point, just make sure your hardware supports the software.

# Hardware Setup
For context, I am using a IP provided WISP AP connected to a [hAP ac³](https://mikrotik.com/product/hap_ac3)

1) Unbox? If you want too
2) Connect to [Power](https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Power)
3) Connect to WAN - Plug in an ethernet cable into port 1 from your internet source.
4) Connect to LAN - Either directly via ethernet or via the WiFi connection. Check your hardware manual for instructions.
5) Click the on button

On thing to note: When I started my router for the first time, it launched two networks (2.4Ghz and 5Ghz). Both of which were **unprotected**! Make sure to secure your network before you leave to do something else. This is explained in [[12.04.02 - Initial Setup (Quick Set)]], but finish this guide first as you cannot configure the network without connecting to it. BE QUICK!
# Connecting to the Router
MAKE SURE YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE ROUTER BEFORE YOU CONTINUE!

To connect to the Router GUI you will need its IP address.

On Windows, open Command Prompt and run
```bash
ipconfig
```

And look for your Default Gateway for the router's ip

```
ipconfig

If you see alot of interfaces like in my output, go to your network settings and check for an active connection.

Go to this address in your control panel to look for an active connection
```
Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center
```

This is how my active networks look
![[Pasted image 20221225214404.png]]
As you can see, my RouterOS interface is `Ethernet 6`

Remember that for ethernet 6, 
`Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.88.1`

Type that into your browser and you should see a login screen.
Go ahead and log in.
Don't forget to check your manual for your router's credentials. Sometimes it might be printed directly onto your router.

# Alternate Connection Methods
## MikroTik App
The app is by far the easiest method of connecting and initializing first setup. It has a very intuitive user interface.

### Connecting to network
On your mobile device, be sure to connect to one of the open networks made available by your router. Once you are connected, head to the app.

From the app, you will see 3 tabs. Click on the `DISCOVERED` tab and you should see your router show up. If this does not happen, then, you will need to locate your router's IP or the default gateway address.

Once you do that, go to the `LOG IN` tab and type your information in.
* Address = Default Gateway address
* Username = admin
* Password = leave empty or check your router's intructions
Click `CONNECT` button
## Winbox
