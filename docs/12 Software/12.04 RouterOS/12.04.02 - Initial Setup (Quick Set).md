Once you've successful connected to your RouterOS web gui and have logged in, there are a couple of things you can mess with.
# Web GUI / Control Panel
Set Mode to `Home AP Dual`
# Internet

# DHCP Configuration
Located under the `Local Network` Block in the `Quick Set` Configuration page you have access to your DHCP settings.

## DHCP Server Range
This is an entry for a IP block that will be used on devices that connect to the device. This is the range of IP's that will be issued to your users.
Some example blocks include:
1)  `192.168.88.10-192.168.88.254` 
2)  `10.0.0.100-10.0.0.254`
3) `192.168.1.10-192.168.1.254`

1 is the Default DHCP Server range btw.
