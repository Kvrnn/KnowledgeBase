Make sure the buckets are unambiguously different. Put a label on each bucket. This forces you to group things quite broadly, but that\u2019s the point. We call these buckets your areas. An area might be Finance . Step 2: In each area, divide in ten again \u00b6 Go through each bucket and repeat the process. This creates your categories . A category within the Finance area might be Tax Returns . Now we have ten areas which contain ten categories each. That\u2019s a hundred categories at the very most . It\u2019s very unlikely you will end up with a hundred categories. Step 3: Organize your files \u00b6 Finally, start to place files that you need to organize into these folders. Try to fit files into already existing categories. The more files you add, the more likely you are to encounter files that do not fit into your categories. Each time this happens consider if you have a lot of files without a home and create a new category to try to encompass as many of them as you can.
